# Udacity_ML_Engineering_Capstone
This project is the analysis of customer segmentation of Arvato Financial service's data in both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning method. 
This project utilizes the data provided by Arvato Financial Services, which is subjected to privacy. However on connecting with the Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nano Degree Program the data will be made available to you. 

Code written in: Python 3
Tool used: Jupyter Notebook
Filename: Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb

Steps followed in the project:
1. Importing all the necessary libraries , for all the Machine Learning algorithm related functions we have used Sklearn library mostly and for visualization - matplotlib. Pandas for the DataFrame structural handling of data and NumPy for handling numerical data
2. After analyzing the data, the required pre-processings are done.
3. Visualizations are used to understand the difference in data before and after processing of the data
4. Perform standard scaling to all the features to bring in uniformity
5. Conduct PCA
6. Perform Unsupervised learning using K-Means and understand contribution of General Data on the Customer data.
7. Process the Training data and apply feature scaling
8. Try out various Supervised learning algorithms on the training data and evaluate the result
9. The best algorithm is used prediction on test data
10. Create submission CSV files for Kaggle

The above steps are performed by either 
Running the kernel by 'Restart and Rull all method'  or executing each cell of the Jupyter Notebook one by one.
